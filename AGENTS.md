# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

This repository is the Lattice UI monorepo.

It contains:

- publishable UI packages under `packages/<layer>/<name>`, where `<layer>` is the target framework
  (currently only `react`; the CLI lives outside that axis under `packages/tools/cli`)
- app workspaces under `apps/*`
  - `apps/playground`: Roblox playground for manual UI verification
  - `apps/loom-preview`: typecheck-only preview integration workspace
  - `apps/test-harness`: Roblox TestEZ harness for package-level behavior checks

Primary goals of changes in this repository:

- preserve stable package boundaries
- keep package exports and package metadata consistent
- avoid regressions in interaction, focus, layer, motion, and overlay behavior
- make minimal, targeted changes instead of broad rewrites unless explicitly requested

## Repository rules

- Use `pnpm`.
- Respect the monorepo layout and existing workspace scripts.
- Respect lockedstep package versioning and workspace conventions.
- Do not introduce ad-hoc package structure changes unless the task is explicitly about package structure.
- Do not rename packages, move large folders, or redesign public APIs unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Prefer surgical fixes over architecture churn.
- Keep user-facing behavior changes aligned with the existing package intent and maturity level.

## Headless UI philosophy

Lattice UI is a headless-first UI toolkit.

Agent guidance for component design:

- Prefer behavior, composition, and state orchestration over opinionated visuals.
- Keep primitives unstyled. A primitive may set behavior props and may neutralize Roblox instance
  defaults that would otherwise impose a look the consumer never asked for (`BackgroundTransparency: 1`,
  `BorderSizePixel: 0`, `Text: ""`, `AutoButtonColor: false`). It may not set colors, static sizes,
  fonts, text content, or decorative `UICorner`/`UIStroke`/`UIPadding` children.
- Geometry computed from state is behavior, not appearance: progress fill ratios, slider thumb travel,
  popper-driven position, scroll thumb size, and presence-driven `Visible` all stay in the primitive.
- Ship no default motion recipes — they encode hardcoded colors and offsets. Own presence *timing*;
  let the consumer supply animation through `transition`.
- When you remove a built-in visual, expose the state it was driven by (see `useMenuItemContext`)
  rather than deleting it, or consumers lose the ability to style that state at all.
- Spread order on a rendered instance is neutral defaults, then consumer passthrough, then behavior
  props, so consumers can override the defaults but never the behavior. Compose consumer `Event`
  handlers and refs instead of replacing them.
- Do not bake product-specific appearance decisions into shared primitives.
- Prefer composability and small wrappers over monolithic, highly opinionated components.
- Preserve or improve flexible composition patterns such as slotting / `asChild`-style usage where already supported.
- Avoid adding unnecessary container layers or visual wrappers just to make implementation easier.
- Shared packages should primarily own interaction logic, accessibility-like semantics, focus flow, layering, portal behavior, and controlled/uncontrolled state behavior.
- Playground scenes and consumer surfaces may demonstrate visuals, but they should not redefine package responsibilities.

When making changes:

- Fix behavior in the primitive when the bug belongs to the primitive.
- Avoid solving primitive problems only through playground styling or scene restructuring.
- Do not turn headless primitives into styled component bundles unless explicitly requested.

## Where to make changes

- Package source code lives in `packages/<layer>/<name>/src`.
- Package public exports should be driven from each package's `src/index.ts`.
- Roblox playground scenes live in `apps/playground/src/client/scenes`.
- Loom preview targets live in `apps/loom-preview/src/preview-targets`.
- Roblox harness tests live in `apps/test-harness/src/tests`.
- Root workspace and release scripts live in the repository root `package.json` and `scripts/*`.

## Roblox environment notes

This repository targets Roblox UI development through TypeScript / roblox-ts workflows.

Agent guidance for Roblox-related work:

- Do not treat this repository like a browser-first React app.
- Do not assume DOM, CSS, or browser globals such as `window`, `document`, `HTMLElement`, or CSS layout behavior.
- Do not assume generic Node.js runtime APIs are available inside package runtime code unless the touched area is explicitly a Node-only script or CLI surface.
- Prefer existing Roblox GUI concepts and patterns used in the repository, such as `UDim2`, `Vector2`, `Frame`, `GuiObject`, `ScreenGui`, selection/focus behavior, and explicit instance props.

Environment-specific expectations:

- `apps/playground` is the primary manual Roblox verification surface.
- `apps/loom-preview` is a preview / approximation surface and should not be treated as the final source of truth for Roblox runtime correctness.
- `apps/test-harness` exists for Roblox-oriented tests. Agents must confirm `Roblox_Studio` MCP server connectivity before using any `test:rbx*` command for validation.
- If the `Roblox_Studio` MCP server is unavailable or unconfirmed, use static reasoning, code inspection, and non-Roblox validation commands instead of Roblox harness execution.
- Before running `test:rbx:headless` or `test:rbx:run`, close any existing Roblox Studio windows so `run-in-roblox` can open the generated place cleanly.

When working on Roblox-facing packages:

- Prefer fixes in the actual package source over scene-only patches.
- Be careful with focus, selection, layering, portals, presence, motion, and popper positioning because these are sensitive to Roblox GUI/runtime behavior.
- Do not claim runtime verification for Roblox behavior unless it was explicitly performed in an approved environment.
- If Roblox runtime behavior cannot be executed, describe conclusions as static reasoning, code inspection, or unverified inference.

Import and module safety:

- Follow existing workspace import conventions.
- Do not introduce direct runtime imports from arbitrary `node_modules` paths in package code.
- Prefer package entrypoints and repository-established patterns for shared code access.

## Motion guidance

This repository uses React for state and composition, but animation and motion behavior should flow through `@lattice-ui/react-motion`.

Agent guidance for motion-related changes:

- Use `@lattice-ui/react-motion` for animation, presence, feedback, and response motion in package and app components.
- Prefer existing motion recipes and hooks such as `usePresenceMotion`, `useResponseMotion`, and `useFeedbackEffect`.
- Do not add direct Roblox animation service usage, custom schedulers, per-frame interpolation, or render-loop animation logic in consuming packages.
- Use React state for semantic UI state such as open/closed, active/inactive, checked/unchecked, or present/absent.
- Do not mirror animation progress back into React state.

Practical expectations:

- `packages/react/motion` owns the motion runtime, scheduler, instance property interpolation, and motion policy behavior.
- Motion disabling or reduced-motion behavior should be handled through `@lattice-ui/react-motion` policy and APIs.
- If a primitive needs new motion behavior, extend `packages/react/motion` recipes, hooks, or public APIs instead of adding one-off animation logic in the primitive.
- Be especially careful with position, size, transparency, and color props that may be controlled by motion APIs.

## Navigation and focus guidance

Lattice ships its own directional-navigation system and does **not** use Roblox's native GUI
selection navigation. All keyboard, gamepad, and programmatic focus movement flows through
`@lattice-ui/react-focus`. Do not reimplement or fall back to native navigation in consumer
packages, playground scenes, or app code.

How the custom navigation works (`packages/react/focus/src/focusManager/navigation/`):

- A single controller drives navigation. It binds input via
  `ContextActionService.BindActionAtPriority` (keyboard arrows + Tab, gamepad D-pad +
  Thumbstick1 with deadzone/auto-repeat) and resolves the next node itself.
- The controller is bound **only while a `FocusScope` is active** (ref-counted
  `retainNavigation` / `releaseNavigation`), and it sets `GuiService.AutoSelectGuiEnabled = false`
  while bound so native auto-selection stays off. When no scope is open, input is not captured
  and normal game controls keep working.
- `GuiService.SelectedObject` is **render-only**: focus state is mirrored *out* to it
  (`bridge.ts`) so the native `SelectionImageObject` and `SelectionGained`/`SelectionLost`
  events still fire, but external selection changes are **not** read back into focus state
  (there is no reverse listener).
- Resolution is hybrid (`resolve.ts`): a scope's `navStrategy` is either `"ordered"` (step by
  node registration order along `navOrientation`, cross-axis moves escape to the parent) or
  `"spatial"` (nearest-centre geometry, GUI-inset invariant). Walks escape up the scope chain
  until a `trapped` scope stops them.

Hard rules:

- Do not use Roblox's built-in selection navigation. Do not set `NextSelectionUp`,
  `NextSelectionDown`, `NextSelectionLeft`, `NextSelectionRight`, `SelectionGroup`, or
  `GuiService.AutoSelectGuiEnabled` to drive navigation.
- Do not read or write `GuiService.SelectedObject` from consumer packages, scenes, or app
  code, and do not treat it as an input - it is an output that `@lattice-ui/react-focus` owns.
- Do not bind `ContextActionService` / `UserInputService` for focus movement outside
  `@lattice-ui/react-focus`. The navigation controller is the single owner of directional input while
  a scope is active.

Do instead:

- Wrap navigable regions in a `FocusScope`, and pick `navStrategy` deliberately: `"ordered"`
  for menus / lists / tab lists (with `navOrientation` and optional `navWrap`), `"spatial"`
  (the default) for free-form 2D layouts. Use `trapped` to contain navigation (overlays,
  dialogs, menus).
- Register focusable nodes with `useFocusNode` and mark focusability with the `Selectable`
  prop; let the controller own traversal, escaping, trapping, and restoration.
- When a widget must consume an arrow itself (text cursor in TextField/Textarea, or future
  value adjust like Slider), return `true` from `getCapturesDirectional(direction)` on its
  focus node instead of intercepting input separately.
- Use `useActivationGuard` for activation, rather than hand-rolling per-component input.
- If navigation behavior is missing, extend the navigation module (controller, `resolve`,
  `spatial`, `candidates`) or the focus registry/engine - never add native selection wiring in
  a consuming primitive or scene.

Note on inline widgets: primitives that are not wrapped in an active `FocusScope`
(e.g. Tabs / RadioGroup / ToggleGroup / Slider used inline) still handle their own arrow keys
via `InputBegan`, because the controller is not bound without an active scope. That is
intentional - do not "fix" them to go through the controller unless they are placed inside a
scope. Menu and Select content are ordered vertical scopes and must stay that way.

The reason: native Roblox navigation ignores Lattice's ordered/spatial resolution, focus
trapping, overlay/layer stacking, and restoration semantics, which produces inconsistent and
unrecoverable focus behavior across primitives and overlays.

## Change strategy

When fixing a bug:

1. Identify the narrowest package or app surface responsible.
2. Change the package first unless the problem is clearly scene-only or harness-only.
3. Avoid "fixing" package bugs only in playground scenes unless the issue is truly local to the scene.
4. Preserve existing APIs unless the task explicitly allows API changes.
5. If behavior depends on focus, layer stacking, portals, presence, motion, or popper positioning, inspect neighboring packages before patching around the symptom.

When adding features:

1. Prefer existing primitives and patterns already used in nearby packages.
2. Keep exports, types, README notes, and tests in sync when public surface changes.
3. Do not add new dependencies unless necessary.

## Validation expectations

Current allowed validation commands:

- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run test:unit`

Do not use `test:rbx*` commands for routine task validation unless `Roblox_Studio` MCP server connectivity has been confirmed first.

Before running `test:rbx:headless` or `test:rbx:run`, close any existing Roblox Studio windows so `run-in-roblox` can open `apps/test-harness/test-harness.rbxlx` cleanly.

If `Roblox_Studio` MCP server connectivity is confirmed, the following root commands are also allowed:

- `pnpm run test:rbx`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:build`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:typecheck`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:prepare`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:place`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:headless`
- `pnpm run test:rbx:run`

Reason:

- the Roblox harness workflow is environment-dependent and requires confirmed MCP-backed Studio access
- agent task completion should not be blocked on Roblox harness availability when MCP access is unavailable
- confirmed MCP access provides an approved path for Roblox runtime validation when the task benefits from it

When reporting validation:

- explicitly report only the commands that were actually run
- claim Roblox runtime or harness verification only when MCP-backed Studio observation or headless execution was actually performed
- report `test:rbx:place` as preparation unless a runtime execution step also ran
- treat `test:rbx:headless` as the automated `run-in-roblox` validation path because it waits for harness status and returns failure through the CLI
- treat `test:rbx:run` as Studio-assisted because it opens the generated place and starts Play mode, but does not by itself prove test results unless MCP-backed Studio observation or another runtime result was captured

## Build and test commands

Common approved root commands:

- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run watch`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run test`
- `pnpm run test:unit`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run format:check`
- `pnpm run check`
- `pnpm run check:fast`

Additional approved root commands when `Roblox_Studio` MCP server connectivity has been confirmed:

- prep: `pnpm run test:rbx`, `pnpm run test:rbx:typecheck`, `pnpm run test:rbx:build`, `pnpm run test:rbx:prepare`, `pnpm run test:rbx:place`
- automated runtime: `pnpm run test:rbx:headless`
- Studio-assisted/manual handoff: `pnpm run test:rbx:run`

Prefer root workspace commands unless the task is explicitly package-local.

## Package conventions

For publishable packages under `packages/<layer>/<name>`:

- preserve `main`, `types`, and `source` conventions
- preserve required files and standard scripts
- keep internal `@lattice-ui/*` dependencies on `workspace:*`
- do not hand-edit version drift across packages unless the task is release/versioning work

If creating a new package, follow the established workspace policy and package defaults rather than inventing a new layout.

## Editing guidance

- Keep code style aligned with the existing repository.
- Follow the current TypeScript / roblox-ts patterns already present in the touched package.
- Avoid unrelated cleanup in files outside the scope of the task.
- Avoid mass formatting changes unless requested.
- Do not replace targeted fixes with broad rewrites.
- Preserve comments and intentional structure when possible.

## For agent behavior

When reporting work:

- state what changed
- state why that package / file was the right place
- state what validation was run
- clearly distinguish "verified" from "not run"

When validation was not run:

- say so plainly
- do not imply runtime verification if only typecheck or static inspection was done

When a task spans multiple packages:

- explain the dependency chain
- keep each change minimal and justified

## Commit and change hygiene

Before committing:

- Run `pnpm run lint:fix` to auto-fix and format the working tree, then confirm `pnpm run lint`
  passes clean. Do not commit with unresolved lint errors.
- Run `pnpm run typecheck` and make sure it passes for any code change.
- For behavior changes, run `pnpm run test:unit` (and Roblox harness commands only when
  `Roblox_Studio` MCP connectivity is confirmed, per the validation rules above).
- `pnpm run check` (`workspace:check` + lint + typecheck + unit tests) is the aggregate gate
  when you want a single command before committing.

Commit messages:

- Follow Conventional Commits, matching the existing history: `type(scope): summary`
  (e.g. `fix(popper): ...`, `feat(focus): ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`, `test(select): ...`).
- Scope is the package or app name without the `@lattice-ui/` prefix (`focus`, `popper`,
  `playground`, `test-harness`), or omitted for repo-wide changes.
- Keep the summary imperative and lowercase; make one logical change per commit.

Changesets:

- Any user-facing change to a publishable package under `packages/<layer>/<name>` needs a changeset
  (`pnpm run changeset:add`). Internal-only, scene-only, tooling, or docs changes usually do not.
- Do not hand-edit versions; let the changeset/release flow own version bumps.

Do not `git push` or open PRs unless explicitly asked. Commit only when the user asks.

## Release and publish safety

This repository has release preparation and publish scripts.
Unless explicitly asked:

- do not run publish commands
- do not modify package versions
- do not generate or apply release/versioning changes
- do not alter release workflow assumptions

## Good defaults

If unsure:

- prefer root `typecheck` over package-local guessing
- prefer package fixes over playground-only patches
- prefer `@lattice-ui/react-focus` over any native Roblox selection navigation
- prefer minimal diffs
- prefer running `lint:fix` + `typecheck` before committing
- prefer adding or updating tests when behavior changes
- prefer explicit notes about environment limitations
